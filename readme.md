# New Game Idea
## Game Concept
A competitive tower defense game that blends multi-player and real-time aspects into the classic tower defense genre.
 Players build both defenses for their own base as well as armies to attack the bases of their enemies.
 
## New Mechanics For An Old Concept
Players of the tower defense genre will be familiar with the general ideas that persist in this game. However, some new
and interesting concepts are introduced.

### Competitive Multi-player
While most tower defense games offer a cooperative multi-player experience, this will bring to life a new aspect - 
competition. Players will simultaneously take the role of what was traditionally the player and defend from constant
waves of enemies and that of the AI by producing those waves for other participants.

### Resource Management
A concept often left to to time or a given starting pool, our game will introduce resource management an economic growth
to the strategy of tower defense. You will be forced to make choices about whether you build for combat or resource
production and react to how your opponent(s) build as well.
Unlike those methods in this game you must build resource generators in order to accumulate wealth. That means the
choice of how much to receive each wave is yours! Despite that extra depth, with only resource to manage the game
retains the simplicity of the tower defense genre.

### Room to Grow
#### Nearly Endless Villages
Our system allows for continued expansion of the villages you build. You decide how to expand your land through our 
system of build radii and shape your own domain. Not only does this allow you build the way you want, it gives you the 
ultimate freedom to shape the paths of incoming minions. We show the paths of incoming minions and how your buildings
will effect them.

#### Deep Progression Tree
Each building and unit has a unique and valuable progression tree and can be upgraded per your plan. The choices you 
make will effect your interactions with all of your enemies, granting you advantages based on how you react to threats. 
Don't like how it played out? Sell your buildings for a partial refunds and anew.
If it doesn't work out, the next match brings a whole new start.

### A Halfway Decent Looking Tower Defense
#### Graphics Look Alright
We all love tower defense, but the tactical fun is too often taking a back seat to the graphical aspects. Not here, our
game looks halfway decent! Not the best but not that bad either. Not only that, but as you advance on your enemy bases 
you can look over those too.

#### Skins! Everyone Loves Those
Post-release we want to offer a few new skins. Nothing pay-to-win but lots of fun. Here's some ideas:

* Ants
* Elves, Dwarves, that stuff
* Modern Military
* Recognizable (Almost) Ponies, that's right, it's a thing now.
* Space Marines

### Achievements!
#### For all the people who can't leave things undone

Achievements help players gain a sense of accomplishment and provide some bragging rights.
