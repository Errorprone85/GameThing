# New Game Idea
## Game Concept
A competitive tower defense game that blends multi-player and real-time aspects into the classic tower defense genre.
 Players build both defenses for their own base as well as armies to attack the bases of their enemies.
 
## New Mechanics For An Old Concept
Players of the tower defense genre will be familiar with the general ideas that persist in this game. However, some new
and interesting concepts are introduced.

### Competitive Multi-player
While most tower defense games offer a cooperative multi-player experience, this will bring to life a new aspect - 
competition. Players will simultaneously take the role of what was traditionally the player and defend from constant
waves of enemies and that of the AI by producing those waves for other participants.

### Resource Management
A concept often left to to time or a given starting pool, our game will introduce resource management an economic growth
to the strategy of tower defense. You will be forced to make choices about whether you build for combat or resource
production and react to how your opponent(s) build as well.
